![Build/Publish](https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/sdf-xarray/actions/workflows/build_publish.yml/badge.svg)
![Tests](https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/sdf-xarray/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

sdf-xarray provides a backend for [xarray](https://xarray.dev) to read SDF files as created by
[EPOCH](https://epochpic.github.io) using the [SDF-C](https://github.com/Warwick-Plasma/SDF_C) library.
Part of [BEAM](#broad-epoch-analysis-modules-beam) (Broad EPOCH Analysis Modules).

## Installation

Install from PyPI with:

```bash
pip install sdf-xarray
```

> [!NOTE]
> For use within jupyter notebooks, run this additional command after installation:
>
> ```bash
> pip install "sdf-xarray[jupyter]"
> ```

or from a local checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/sdf-xarray.git
cd sdf-xarray
pip install .
```

We recommend switching to [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage packages.

## Usage

### Single file loading

```python
import xarray as xr

df = xr.open_dataset("0010.sdf")

print(df["Electric_Field_Ex"])

# <xarray.DataArray 'Electric_Field_Ex' (X_x_px_deltaf_electron_beam: 16)> Size: 128B
# [16 values with dtype=float64]
# Coordinates:
#   * X_x_px_deltaf_electron_beam  (X_x_px_deltaf_electron_beam) float64 128B 1...
# Attributes:
#     units:    V/m
#     full_name: "Electric Field/Ex"
```

### Multi-file loading

To open a whole simulation at once, pass `preprocess=sdf_xarray.SDFPreprocess()`
to `xarray.open_mfdataset`:

```python
import xarray as xr
from sdf_xarray import SDFPreprocess

with xr.open_mfdataset("*.sdf", preprocess=SDFPreprocess()) as ds:
    print(ds)

# Dimensions:
# time: 301, X_Grid_mid: 128, ...
# Coordinates: (9) ...
# Data variables: (18) ...
# Indexes: (9) ...
# Attributes: (22) ...
```

`SDFPreprocess` checks that all the files are from the same simulation, as
ensures there's a `time` dimension so the files are correctly concatenated.

If your simulation has multiple `output` blocks so that not all variables are
output at every time step, then those variables will have `NaN` values at the
corresponding time points.

## Broad EPOCH Analysis Modules (BEAM)

![BEAM logo](./BEAM.png)

BEAM is structured as a set of independent yet complementary open-source tools designed for analysing [EPOCH](https://epochpic.github.io/) simulations where researchers can adopt only the components they need, without being constrained by a rigid framework. The packages are as follows:

- [sdf-xarray](https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/sdf-xarray): Reading and processing SDF files and converting them to [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/).
- [epydeck](https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/epydeck): Input deck reader and writer.
- [epyscan](https://github.com/PlasmaFAIR/epyscan): Create campaigns over a given parameter space using various sampling methods.
